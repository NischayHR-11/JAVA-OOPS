## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Java projects and examples that demonstrate the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It serves as a learning resource for those who are new to OOP or who want to reinforce their understanding of OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools are utilized in this repository:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for all examples and projects.
- **JUnit**: For writing and running tests.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NischayHR-11/JAVA-OOPS.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd JAVA-OOPS
    ```

3. **Set up your environment:**
   - Ensure you have JDK installed.
   - Optionally, set up an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for easier project navigation.

4. **Build and run the project:**
   - Compile and run the Java files using your IDE or the command line.

## Usage

Each directory within the repository focuses on a specific OOP concept, containing relevant Java files and examples. You can navigate to each folder, review the code, and run the examples to understand how each OOP concept is implemented in Java.

### Example Usage:

To compile and run an example using the command line:

```bash
javac Example.java
java Example
```
